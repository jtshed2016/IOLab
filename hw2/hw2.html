			<p>Berkeley buyers, like all East Bay house-hunters, want to throw their hands up in the air and curse the gods right now.  The numbers around single-family homes back up this scream-at-the-heavens challenge for Berkeley buyers. (Sourced from the local MLS and analyzed by Red Oak Realty).</p>

			<br>
			<p>Berkeley's scraping the bottom of the listings barrel. The city had 2,000 listings in 2015, down 2% from 2014 and nearly 25% down from 2012's 2,647 total. In 2015, the median Berkeley home sale price jumped to an all-time, eye-popping high of $1.05 million, a 19% leap from 2014, and a 66% skyscrape from the 10-year low of $630,000 in 2011.  Bummed yet?</p>  
			<aside id="bummed">Bummed yet?</aside>
			<p>On average, Berkeley homes went for 17.1% over asking in 2015, by far the highest measure in a decade. That's a jump of 3.2 percentage points over 2014's list-to-sale price. In 2011, homes went 2 under asking. Homes flew off the market quicker in 2015 than they have in a decade, remaining available for an average of just 20 days. This speed was most closely matched in 2013, when homes lasted an average of 22 days.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To win a home, Berkeley buyers must be persistent, diligent, a bit lucky and have a great agent.  Offering top dollar is the chief factor in winning a home, but Berkeley buyers can employ a number of tactics to gain a competitive edge over the many hungry competitors poring over homes like undergrads tackling blueberries on Berkeley Bowl's discount rack.  A few Red Oak Realty agents shared how they and their buyer clients won homes in 2015.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>1. Offer gifts to the seller</h2>
			<p>If you have a cool, appealing skill or service, lump it into the offer. Red Oak Realty agent Charity Ankrum - member of the Leif Jenssen, Charity Ankrum and Tamir Monsour Team - has had buyers who are massage therapists, chefs, photographers and personal trainers include their services in their offers, which helped them win homes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Sellers have rarely taken buyers up on the offer, she said. But it serves as a personal gesture that sometimes sways sellers staring at multiple competitive offers.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>2. Find your own listing</h2>
			<p>Inventory is so low that if you find a neighborhood you love, you might not ever get in unless you start knocking on doors.</p>
			<br>

			<p>That's exactly what a buyer client of Red Oak Realty agent Terri White's did last year after scouring the market for several months from El Cerrito to Oakland. The couple fell in love with a neighborhood on the Kensington/Berkeley border and one day decided to just start knocking on doors.</p>

			<br>
			<p>It took about a dozen knocks, but they found someone willing to sell. They bought the home for $870,000 last fall.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This tactic can work, because some homeowners don't want the hassle of preparing their homes for sale even if they're amenable to selling, White said. This proactive move short-circuits that process.</p>

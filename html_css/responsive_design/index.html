					<p>In March 2014, I staged a plausibly deniable bloodless overthrow of a foreign territory.  This was done in order to protect ethnic Russians, return a historically significant territory to its Russian homeland (redressing the historical injustice perpetrated by Khrushchev in 1954), secure Russia's military presence in the Black Sea, and prevent fascist chaos.  The restored territory brought Russia seven fixer-upper defense plants, a formerly secret submarine base, significant wine-growing regions, and vast growth potential for energy infrastructure and tourism development.</p>

				<div class="project-detail">
					<p>In February 2014, the XXII Winter Olympic Games were held in Sochi, Russia.  This event was a triumph of civil, financial, and information engineering.  Not only did I successfully stage a winter sports spectacle in one of the few sub-tropical zones in a country whose lands stretch into the Arctic and features some of the coldest inhabited places on Earth, but the development of facilities for the Games provided a flexible financial vehicle for enriching Moscow real estate developers and construction contractors. </p>

				<div class="project-detail">
					<p>Since March 2011, I have supported the brotherly nation of Syria in its fight against NATO-backed terrorist aggression, seeking to preserve its statehood and territorial integrity, as well as preserving a Russian presence on the Mediterranean.  I have provided political coverage in the UN and military backing on Syrian territory. In September 2013, I engineered the peaceful elimination of Syria's chemical weapons, depriving the aggressive US President Obama of a pretext for an invasion.</p>
